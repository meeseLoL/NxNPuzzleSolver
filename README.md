# NxNPuzzleSolver
NXN puzzle solver using BFS 
This is a nxn puzzle solver that uses BFS of a binary tree to solve any variation of an NXN number puzzle.


currently this will only do a 3x3 without issue.

we tried a 6x6 but it will take comically long to solve.

eventually plan on updating the efficiency however this can help you solve puzzles.

just change the puzzle state at the bottom (in main) to your puzzle you need solved and run the program.
